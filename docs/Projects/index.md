### RepPoints-x-Libra-R-CNN-x-Transformer-self-attention  
__Description:__ 
This project builds upon the RepPoints model by [Yang et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11490). We balance the training of the model using Libra R-CNN and then further improve the performance using Transformer Attention.
We also implement our KQRAttention mechanism to improve the inference speed of the model.
